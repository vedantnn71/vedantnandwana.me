This is my personal website / portfolio. Feel free to contribute to the project or raise any sort of issue if you have any problem.

**Used Tech Stack**
- Next.js w/ typescript
- Tailwind for styling
- Radix as a headless component library
- Headles UI for transitions w/ tailwind
- Sanity.io for content
- Vercel for deployment
- SWR for data fetching

P.S: I've temporarily hosted it over a random vercel deploy url, I'll move it my personal domain soon.
